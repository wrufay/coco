# Privacy Policy for Coco

**Last updated:** December 26, 2025

## Overview

Coco is a Chrome extension designed to help students manage co-op and internship applications. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## What Data We Collect

Coco collects job application information that you voluntarily enter, including:

- Company names
- Job titles and roles
- Locations
- Application deadlines
- Application status (wishlist, applied, interview, offer)
- Personal notes
- Job posting URLs

## How We Use Your Data

Your data is used to:

- Store and organize your job applications locally on your device
- Categorize jobs by role type using Claude AI
- Extract job information from web pages you visit
- Analyze your resume against saved jobs to provide personalized recommendations

## Data Storage

All job application data is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's Storage API. We do not operate servers or maintain databases. Your data never leaves your device except when you explicitly use AI-powered features.

## Third-Party Services

Coco uses **Claude AI** (provided by Anthropic) for the following features:

- AI-powered job categorization
- Resume analysis and skill gap assessment
- Job information extraction from web pages

When you use these features, your data (job listings and/or resume) is sent to Anthropic's API. Please review [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) for information on how they handle data.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties, except:

- **Anthropic (Claude AI):** Only when you use AI features, and only the specific data needed for that feature

## Your Rights

You maintain full control over your data:

- All data is stored locally on your device
- You can delete individual jobs at any time
- You can remove all data by uninstalling the extension
- We cannot access your data - it exists only on your device

## Permissions

Coco requests the following Chrome permissions:
